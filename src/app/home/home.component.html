        <h3>About Rare Diseases</h3>
        <p>In the United States, a rare disease is defined as disease that affects less than 200,000 people. With 7,000
            known rare diseases affecting 30 million Americans and an estimated 350 million people worldwide. Of those
            statistics, about 75% of rare diseases are children, and about 30% of patients with rare diseases will not
            live past the age of 5. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In 1983, the FDA approved The Orphan Drug Act which gives incentives to companies that work to develop
            treatments for rare diseases. Since then, there have been nearly 350 treatments approved for various rare
            diseases.</p>
